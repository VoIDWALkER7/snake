This is just a snake game built in C. 
If you are interested in testing it, be my guest, though keep in mind, i will be adding more stuff to it as well. 
To test it, you can clone it to your desktop using the command git clone ```https://github.com/VoIDWALkER7/snake.git```.
Then ```cd snake``` and the make the file using the ```make``` command. 
After that, just type ```./snake``` on your desktop to run it and it will work. Feel free to raise an issue in case you find any. Thank you for your support.
